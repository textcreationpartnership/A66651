            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. In ſome Counties, Towns, and other places of the Realm, there be ſpeciall Uſages time out of mind, differing from the Common Law, which are called <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p n="1">I. WE have hitherto ſpoken of poſſeſſions, (being the firſt and hardeſt part of the law;) The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35929:13"/> other remaineth, which miniſtreth juſtice in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of offences.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. An offence is the doing of any wrong, and it is a wrong without force, or to the which force is coupled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. In thoſe of the firſt kinde, the offender is to be amerced, <hi>viz.</hi> to pay a petty ſum of money to the King, and if he be a Peer of the Realm, then C. S.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The Kings wife ſhall never be amerced.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Offences without force are Treſpaſſes upon the caſe, or Real wrongs.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Treſpaſſe upon the caſe is ſuch an offence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any thing is endamaged, and it is a miſuſer, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and conſpiracie</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Miſuſer, when by meer wrong it is endamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Of this kinde there be many, and thoſe of divers ſorts; as if a man maliciouſly utter any falſe ſlander to the endangering of one in law.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The touching of him with ſome heinous crime.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. The impairing his trade of life.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. If one having another mans goods, convert them to his own uſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. If a Sheriffe ſuffer one in execution for debt to go at large.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. If a Smith prick my horſe, or kill him in cure.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. If being committed to the Gaole, the Gaoler of malice puts upon me ſo many Irons, or otherwiſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me ſo hardly, that I become lame thereby, &amp;c</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. But two above the reſt do here require more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conſideration. <hi>viz.</hi> Diſturbance and Nuſance.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. Diſturbance is the hindring of that, which in right belongeth to one to do.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. Nuſance is annoyance done to ones here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. All manner of Nuſances are to be removed, and common nuſances any man may pull down.</p>

                     <p n="19">XIX. Deceit is when the damage groweth by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſlight; As if in play one win anothers money by falſe dice or if he that ſelleth any thing, do upon the ſale, warrant it to be thus and thus, whereby the other is deceived.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. Conſpiracie is, where two or more conſpire to do one wrong, or the like.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. There are certain other offences againſt the Law, which are in the nature of treſpaſſes upon the caſe, and by the Kings prerogative puniſhable like to them.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. Of this ſort are Nonſuit in an action, fault in the Original writ, or (by the Sheriffe) in the return of a writ, making default when he ſhould appear, and whatſoever other offences (not being with force and armes) which offer no direct injury to a common perſon.</p>

                     <p n="4">IV. An Aſſize of ones own poſſeſſion, is an Aſſize of novel diſſeiſin, or an Aſſize of nuſance.</p>
